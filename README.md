# searchHouses
I tried to make use of linear search algorithm by building a simple app where there are six html element including a search box, a search button, paragraphs and image element.
# how it works
Since the algorithm is the only thing that counts I used dummy data.
so enter a search field with "kicukiro" or "nyarungenge" or "gasabo" and then press search button to get the houses that are available in that area
